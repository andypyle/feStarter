# feStarter
My personal Front-End starter kit.

## About
This is simply my personal way of getting a Front-End project off the ground quickly.

It uses [Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs), [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/), [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/), and [Browserify](http://browserify.org/).

I've also included [VelocityJS](http://julian.com/research/velocity/) for UI animation, which also installs [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) as a dependency.

## Installation

Keep in mind, I made this primarily for my own personal use, but if you want to check it out:

1. Fork the repo
2. Clone it.
3. Install dependencies: `npm install && bower install`
